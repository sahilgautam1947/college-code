# the software developement process is a lot more than just programming as 
# it takes a lot to write a good code 

# first of all the need for programming is analysed that may be customer project or some other requirement 
# the next thing that is done is to analyse what the programm will do 
# the next step is design that is how the programm will do the task required 
# then comes the coding step in which the code is written 
# then it is the integration part in which we combine the smaller parts to make a smoothly working programm which is not easy 
# and the most important part is maintainence which is usually the most expensive one 


# sometinmtimes bugs are found in the programm so as to solve them we may have to go to the previous steps also 



# Q List four phases of the software development process, and explain what they accomplish

# ans 

#     requirement 
#     what the programm will do 
#     how the programm will do 
#     coding part 
#     integration 
#     implimentation
#     maintainence 


# Q Jack says that he will not bother with analysis and design but proceed directly to coding his programs.
#  Why is that not a good idea?

#  ans 

#      this is not a good idea as to write a good code it is the basic requirement that thorough analysis is done 
#      so as to prevent bugs or unstabilirty issues in later stages 
#      also if some thing like a blue print or a pseudocode is made in advanced then it then becomes really easy 
#      to code when the logic has been previously build and the planning has been done 

# new shotcut discovered 
# if you press ctrl+shift plus any arrow keys then a word gets selected and 
# that combination of words is highlighted in the whole code
